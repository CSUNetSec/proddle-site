            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Proddle is a distributed network measurement project running
                at Colorado State University in the Network Security research
                group. The aim of the project is to perform periodic service
                level measurements from geographically diverse vantage points
                to determine domain availability and similar networking
                failures. There are many well established projects actively 
                probing the Internet. While Proddle offers the ability to 
                perform network level measurements (ping, traceroute, etc) we
                propose analyzing a higher layer to closer mimic user interaction.
                Therefore, in additon to performing network layer measurements 
                provided by existing infrastructure, we'll provide the ability
                to perform much more versatile measurements.
            </p>

            <h3>Vantages</h3>
            <p>
                Currently all of our vantages are hosted on Microsoft's Azure
                cloud infrastructure under a generous research sponsorship. We
                are very interested in deploying additional instances.

            <div id="map"></div>
            </br>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <caption><b>Active Vantages From Last 24 Hours</b></caption>
                <div id="vantagesScroll" class="scroll">
                    <table id="vantagesTable" class="report">
                        <thead>
                            <th>Hostname</th>
                            <th>Ip Address</th>
                            <th>Measurement</th>
                            <th>Count</th>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody id="vantagesBody"></tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </div>
            </br>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
                As a research centric project all measurement results are 
                made publicly available. We believe this is a dataset that's 
                currently unavailable to the broader community and has the potential 
                to spark new and interesting research initiatives.
            </p>

            <p>
                As stated previously, all results are stored in JSON format. This
                allows for an unparalleled level of verbosity. Our current HTTP
                GET measurement stores application layer latency, DNS resolution,
                redirect count, reply content, HTTP status codes, URL redirects 
                and much more.
            </p>

            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways for interested parties to aid this effort.
                The most obvious being deploying a vantage point locally. As
                the project is in it's infancy this is a fairly manual process,
                but intial efforts at containerizing the application using docker
                have been met with success. Another mutually useful effort would 
                be to use the data for interesting research. Currently, all 
                measurement results are stored as JSON, alas we are quite open
                to providing alternative formats on request. Any additional
                thoughts on increasing the communites scope of the project will
                be well recieved. 
            </p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The architecture is covered extesively in the 
                <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> section. Alas
                a brief description will be provided here. Our backend is run
                by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>. It is a very
                interesting project that stores information in JSON documents.
                Additionally it provides data replication and sharding required
                of most modern database deployments. On top of that we have
                implemented a very lightweight bridge application to transport data
                from vantages to the backend. A bridge acts as
                a passive entity, meaning all communication is initiated by the
                vantage points. The final component is the vantage
                point. It's purpose is to actively perform measurements and relay
                results to bridges. It should be noted that implementation is such
                that multiple bridges will be running over a MongoDB replication
                cluster. Therefore the system has a fail-safe in the case of 
                unreachability.

            <p>
                The team currently consists of researchers at Colorado State
                University in the Network Security group. We are very open to 
                collaborative efforts and urge all interested parties to contact
                us.
