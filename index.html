            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Proddle is a distributed network measurement project running
                at Colorado State University in the Network Security research
                group. The aim of the project is to perform periodic service
                level measurements from geographically diverse vantage points
                to determine DDoS and similar networking
                anomalies. There are many well established projects actively 
                probing the Internet. While Proddle offers the ability to 
                perform network level measurements (ping, traceroute, etc) we
                propose analyzing a higher layer to closer mimic user interaction.
                Therefore, in additon to performing network layer measurements 
                provided by existing infrastructure, we'll provide the ability
                to perform much more versatile measurements.

            <h3>Vantages</h3>
            <div>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
                To begin, as a research centric project all results are made
                publicly available. We believe this is a dataset that's currently
                unavailable to the broader community and has the potential to 
                spark new and interesting research initiatives. Results are
                stored as JSON strings, but we are willing to provide a different
                format for interested parties. Feel free to contact us.
            </p>

            <p>
                As stated previously, all results are stored in JSON format. This
                allows for an unparalleled level of verbosity. Our current HTTP
                GET measurement stores application layer latency, DNS resolution,
                redirect count, reply content, HTTP status codes, and much more.
            </p>

            <h3>Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways for interested parties to aid this effort.
                The most obvious being deploying a vantage point locally. As
                the project is in it's infancy this is a fairly manual process,
                but intial efforts at containerizing the application using docker
                have been fairly success. Another mutually useful effort would 
                be to use the data for interesting research. we are quite 
                happy to entertain alternative formats on request. Any additional
                thoughts on increasing the communites scope of the project will
                be well recieved. 
            </p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The architecture is covered extesively in the 
                <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> section. Alas
                a brief description will be provided here. Our backend is run
                by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>. It is a very
                interesting project that stores information in JSON documents.
                Additionally it provides data replication and sharding required
                of most modern database deployments. On top of that we have
                implemented a very lightweight server application that acts as
                a passive entity, meaning all communication is initiated by the
                vantage points. The server handles all communication between the
                vantage points and MongoDB. The final component is the vantage
                point. It's purpose is to actively perform measurements and relay
                results to servers. It should be noted that implementation is such
                that multiple servers will be running over a MongoDB replication
                cluster. Therefore the system has a fail-safe in the case of 
                unreachability.

            <p>
                The team currently consists of researchers at Colorado State
                University in the Network Security group. We are very open to 
                collaborative efforts and urge all interested parties to contact
                us.
